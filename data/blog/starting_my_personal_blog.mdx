As someone who has always been interested in sharing my thoughts and experiences with others, starting a personal blog was a natural step for me. However, I had never done anything like this before and didn't know where to start. That's when I discovered [blog.railway.app](https://blog.railway.app). I have been using their service for the past few months without knowing they also open sourced their blog ðŸ˜›

The process of setting up my blog was surprisingly easy. I simply followed the instructions provided on railwayâ€™s blog GitHub source code and customized the design to my liking using React, Tailwind, and Next.js. While I had some prior experience with these technologies, I was by no means an expert. I added a few nifty things such as fetching now playing track from Spotify and Iâ€™m planning to add more fun interactive things.

Now that my blog is up and running, I hope to be consistent in writing and sharing my experiences with others. I believe that a personal blog is an excellent way to connect with people who share similar interests and to learn from others.

In conclusion, starting a personal blog may seem daunting, but with the right tools and resources, it can be a fun and rewarding experience.
