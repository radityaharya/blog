Heyyo to the 0 people reading this blog! I'm still grinding away, trying to be consistent with my blog posts, it‚Äôs going great! I‚Äôm aiming to post at least once a week. Let‚Äôs get going to this week‚Äôs topic

Now lemme tell yall something, I‚Äôm reaaaaaaaly bad at writing css like real bad, and yes i search ‚ÄúHow to center a div‚Äù on a regular basis. I felt attacked on a personal level whenever i see that meme.

When I cloned Railway's blog, I discovered the magical land of Tailwind. With Tailwind, I don't have to write CSS from scratch anymore. I don't have to think in pixels, ems, or rems when spacing things or sizing fonts. I don't have to fiddle with media queries either. Instead, Tailwind provides a set of pre-defined classes that I can use to style my components. I simply add the classes to my react components and voila! My website looks great without me having to write any custom CSS. 

One thing I have noticed is that using Tailwind classes can sometimes make the codebase look cluttered and messy. It can be overwhelming to see so many classes applied to a single element. However, I have come to realize that the benefits of using Tailwind far outweigh the visual clutter. Not only does it save me time and effort in writing custom CSS, but it also ensures consistency across my entire codebase. With Tailwind, I can easily make changes to the styling of my website without having to search through my entire codebase for every instance of a particular style. So while it may not always look pretty, the efficiency and consistency benefits make using Tailwind classes well worth it in the end.

In conclusion, Tailwind has been a game-changer for me as someone who struggles with writing CSS. I‚Äôm looking forward to use it on my next projects and by the way i finally made the repository for this blog publicüëÄ you can find it [here](https://github.com/radityaharya/blog)
