One of the most exciting features of GitHub Copilot X is its chat interface. It is deeply embedded into IDEs like VS Code and Visual Studio, and can provide in-depth analysis and explanations of code blocks, generate unit tests, and even propose fixes to bugs.

GitHub Copilot X also brings support for pull requests. It can automatically generate PR descriptions based on changes made in a branch, and point out missing unit tests and generate new test cases after every build.

In addition to these features, GitHub Copilot X can answer questions on your projects by leveraging its understanding of your codebase and documentation.

Overall, GitHub Copilot X is an exciting tool for developers that promises to help them be more productive, focus on more satisfying work, and build better software for everyone.
